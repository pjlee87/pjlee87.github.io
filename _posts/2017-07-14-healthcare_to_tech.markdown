The past year has been comprised of a series of life-changing events - had I not experienced those growing pains, I wouldn't be here and I'd remain miserable in my former profession.

Like kismet, I met a software engineer at a time when I was supposed to start my doctoral program, and he opened my eyes to the possibilities in the tech industry. Long story short - I skipped grad school, quit my job, released an app called FStop with that software engineer, and now I'm here. 

I don't recall ever feeling this passionately about anything. I wake up every morning, excited to learn, code, and create. I'm all in.
